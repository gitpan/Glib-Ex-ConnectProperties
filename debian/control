Description: link properties between objects in Glib-Perl
 Glib::Ex::ConnectProperties establishes a link between properties on
 different objects, so a change to any one of them is propagated to
 others.
 .
 This is helpful for tying say the "active" of a Gtk2::CheckButton
 control to the "active" of some target widget.  The button controls
 the widget, but the button also gets updated if the target changes by
 some other means.
